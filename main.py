# Task1
# detect each of the yellow shapes on the video frames. Classify the shapes into
# classes: circle, rectangle, triangle. Make an output video with each of the shapes signed by
# the name of its class. Mark the classes with different colors. The shapes which are partly
# visible may be ignored.
